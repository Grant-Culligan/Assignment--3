    <h2 class="des">Computer Engineers evaluate, test, maintain computer hardware and software. They develop, design new computer parts, like circuitboards, network systems, computer processors. Computer Engineers help ressolve problems/address any concerns to due with hardware/software related features; aid in the advancement computer technology. The responsibilities of a computer engineer include, desinging and testing robots, researching software and computer hardware, writing and testing software for devices, managing operating systems, testing hardware components like processors, circuit boards.<br>Most positions of computer engineering employers require a bachelor's degree in computer science, some Computer Engineers major in mathmatics, software engineering or electrical engineering.<br>The career outlook for Computer Engineers is expected to grow about 5% from 2016-2026.<br>The average salary for a Canadian based computer engineer is 74,969/year as of April 30, 2021.<br>I would be intrested in becomoing a Computer Engineer because I like having to adapt, be flexible, inovate. With the constant innovation of hardware and software technology, I think being a Computer Engineer encompasses that well.</h2>
    <h2 class="des">The Institiution that I would like to develop my computer Engineering skills is the University of Waterloo.<br>The entrance requirements for Computer Engineering in this University are at least a final grade of 70% of 5 courses: Advanced Functions, Calculus and Vectors, Chemistry, Physics, and English. To be Eligble to enter the University with the influence of Computer Engineering in mind.<br>If I attend this college for the sake of developing my Computer Engineering skills, I would take the Computer Engineering program, the Computer Science program, or the Data Science Program; which all have similar entry requirements.<br>This program has a cost per year of $61,300.<br>The program takes five years to complete.<h2>
    <h2 class="des">Becoming a Computer Engineer will help the common good because the advancement of technology is overall very positive for everyone, and very helpful.<br>Computer Engineering will help me prioritize Computer science/Engineering related courses more than other courses, like Physical education, Biology. I blievethe way Computer Engineers think is also different from other non engineers. Being an Engineer will help your problem solving, and help you think outside the box when solving problems. Giving more difference to perosnal life.</h2>
